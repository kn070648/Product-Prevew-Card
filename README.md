### Links

- Live Site URL: [Product-Preview-Card](https://kn070648.github.io/Product-Prevew-Card/))

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design with media queries

### What I learned

During this learning process, I found out how to use the <picture> element and <source> tag to show different images for different devices. This helps my webpage load faster and look better on any screen size. It also makes my webpage more flexible and responsive. This technique improves the user experience and helps me understand more about responsive design.

```html
<picture class="image-container">
  <source
    media="(max-width: 600px)"
    srcset="./images/image-product-mobile.jpg"
  />
  <img src="./images/image-product-desktop.jpg" alt="purfume-image" />
</picture>
```

### Continued development

In the future, I will study responsive design more deeply and use it in my work. I hope this will bring a better experience to users on all devices.
